                    Wien2Wannier: TODO's and Ideas
                    ==============================

General:

 * investigate ‘make all’ fail in SRC_w2w

 * test suite (what?)

 * use ``make’’ to automate Wannier process???

 * add wien2wannier to Files Table in UG

 * move chk reading to module

 * update write_inwplot

 * adjust array order
   
 * add version to NEWS, maybe file VERSION

 * remove copyright claim from SRC_trig/Makefile.orig


wplot2xsf:

 * phase?

 * what about 0/1/2-dim?
   - 2d is supported by XCrysDen

 * support r-parallelization


findbands:

 * which file to use?  (spaghetti_ene?) -- this affects prepare_w2wdir

 * Fermi energy from ‘insp’?


prepare_w2wdir:

 * -q should suppress not-found error from cut


init_w2w:

 * check for klist_band


join_vectorfiles:

 * “energy-only” option


w2w:

 * use ‘inwfmod’ to read input file


wplot:

 * use ‘inwfmod’ to read that file

 * check mode ‘ANY’

 * sort out ‘WAN’ nonsense

 * check RLOs

 * support r-parallelization

 * inconsistent k-points between chk and vector should fail, not give
   NaN


woptic:

 * move “refine_tetra” to beginning of woptic iteration

 * what about spin-orbit?

 * convert to use ‘def’ file, or some other more sensible way

 * make check for ‘case.symop’ compulsory when necessary

 * woptic vs. $SCRATCH
   

woptic_main:

 * fix scissors shift, chemical potential

 * apply chemical potential to interacting states or all states?

 * As a function of internal frequency spacing, the dc quantities
   converge much slower than the (higher-Ω) optical conductivity.
   Does it make sense to have an extra “dc ω grid”?


refine_tetra:

 * figure out correct size for VOE


woptic-interpolate_vr:

 * make interpolation work with ``rotmatrix''

 * interpolation out of Wannier subspace: can disentanglement help?

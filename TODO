                    Wien2Wannier: TODO's and Ideas
                    ==============================

General:

 * investigate ‘make all’ fail in SRC_w2w

 * test suite (what?)

 * use ``make’’ to automate Wannier process???

 * add wien2wannier to Files Table in UG

 * move chk reading to module

 * update write_inwplot

 * adjust array order
   
 * add version to NEWS, maybe file VERSION

 * remove copyright claim from SRC_trig/Makefile.orig


wplot2xsf:

 * phase?

 * what about 0/1/2-dim?
   - 2d is supported by XCrysDen


findbands:

 * which file to use?  (spaghetti_ene?) -- this affects prepare_w2wdir

 * Fermi energy from ‘insp’?


prepare_w2wdir:

 * -q should suppress not-found error from cut


init_w2w:

 * check for klist_band


join_vectorfiles:

 * “energy-only” option


w2u:

 * move module ``wcLDA_util´´ to separate file


wplot:

 * check mode ‘ANY’

 * sort out ‘WAN’ nonsense

 * check RLOs

 * xsf vs. Bohr?

 * inconsistent k-points between chk and vector should fail, not give
   NaN


woptic:

 * move “refine_tetra” to beginning of woptic iteration

 * what about spin-orbit?

 * convert to use ‘def’ file, or some other more sensible way

 * make check for ‘case.symop’ compulsory when necessary
   

woptic_main:

 * w / maxw: why does it go to 2*Emax?  Why all the ‘-1’s?

 * apply chemical potential to interacting states or all states?


refine_tetra:

 * figure out correct size for VOE


woptic-interpolate_vr:

 * make interpolation work with ``rotmatrix''

 * interpolation out of Wannier subspace: can disentanglement help?

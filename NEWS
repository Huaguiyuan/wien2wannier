                          *****************

Version 2.0 introduces backward-incompatible changes in the format of
`case.inwplot':

  - Removed the `switch' and `iseig' options.  They were leftovers
    from `lapw7', unused in `wplot' (`switch' had to equal `WAN' and
    `iseig' was ignored).

  - Added a boolean option `wfrot'.  If set, `wplot' reads a unitary
    matrix from `case.wfrot' to be applied to the WFs before plotting.

  - Removed the `nD' grid types for n=0,1,2 a redundant; i.e., only
    the options `ANY' and `3D' remain.  Lower-dimensional grids can
    easily be generated as special cases of `3D', or using `ANY'.

In addition, `write_inwplot` has been removed.

A script `checkinwplot' is provided that checks an input file for
conformance to the new format and converts old-style input files.  `x
wplot' calls this script automatically.

Bugfixes and enhancements include:

* In `write_win':

  - fixed calculation of atom positions; `atoms_cart' is the default
    over `atoms_frac' because it appears to behave better numerically

  - fixed handling of Wannier90 options given on the command line

  - fixed bugs related to `mp_grid', `bands_plot', and
    `guiding_centres'

  - implemented support for both old-format (5-digit integers) and
    new-format (10-digit integers) `klist' files

* In `w2w':

  - adapted `w2w' to work with `-p -so'

  - fixed crashes with an error ``read statement [from vectorso]
    requires too much data'' in the presence of SOC

  - fixed spurious complex conjugation in `case.mmn'

  - fixed a bug resulting in segmentation faults for some cases

* Fixed the normalization of real-space Wannier functions in
  `case.psink' by number of k-points (previously, the WFs as printed
  included a factor of `N_k')

* Fixed a Makefile bug affecting `w2w' and `wplot' where real and
  complex modules were mixed (cf. mailing list <goo.gl/WbMb0w>).

================

Version 1.0 represents a major overhaul of the user interface.  In
particular:

* Wien2k integration:

  - (most) wien2wannier programs are now called via Wien2k's `x'
    script

  - wien2wannier is set up to be installed inside the $WIENROOT
    directory.

* some names changed to conform to Wien2k conventions, e.g. the
  `w2win' file is now called `inwf', and the program that produces it
  is `write_inwf'

Other changes and new features include:

* `write_inwf' brings many new features over the old `write_w2win',
  e.g.

  - flexible selection of initial projections [real-valued spherical
    harmonics (s through f), s/p/d hybrids, and certain
    symmetry-related groups (e.g. d-t2g)]

  - an arbitrary rotation can be applied to each initial projection

  - tab-completion, readline, and history support

* fix handling of k-points for various lattice types

* `shift_energy' and `join_vectorfiles' are no longer needed (setting
  the Fermi energy is done by `w2w'; `w2w' and `wplot' can read
  parallel vector files)

* wien2wannier may now be used under the GNU GPL (see file `COPYING')

* removed all Unicode (non-ASCII) characters from the messages printed
  by wien2wannier, they were causing problems for some users

* ``guiding centers'' are enabled by default in case.win

* added -efermi, -scf switches (to specify Fermi energy) to
  `prepare_w2wdir'

* fixed a bug in `wplot2xsf --xsf-files' in the case of multiple files

* fixed a bug in `x' relating to `x joinvec -p'


Changes in 1.0-β4 include:

* fixed bug in `write_inwf' that occured for element names starting
  with `A' or `Z'

* corrected filename for Hamiltonian in `x convham'

* fixed typo in `wplot2xsf' that caused it to abort


Changes in 1.0-β3 include:

* fixed handling of -noshift in `wplot2xsf_lapw'

* fixed a bug in convham.f that produced bogus numbers

* fixed a bug in get_kmesh_band() that affected `write_win'

* added option -N to `wplot2xsf' to explicitly give WF numbers

* renamed `x join_vectorfiles' -> `x joinvec'


Changes in 1.0-β2 include:

* fixed bug in get_kmesh_klist() that affected `convert_hamiltonian'
  when compiled with ifort

* fixed handling of empty $SCRATCH in `x_lapw'

* adapted `x w2waddsp' for MMN-only and AMN-only modes

* corrected eV-Ry conversion constant

* fixed atom numbering and Bohr-Angstrom conversion constant in
  `wplot2xsf'

* renamed convert_hamiltonian -> convham

                Wien2Wannier Installation Instructions
                **************************************
            

1. Unpacking
============

In this directory there is a tarball wien2wannier.tar which should be
extracted in the Wien2k directory,

   $ cd $WIENROOT
   $ tar -xvf .../wien2wannier-X.Y/wien2wannier.tar

C a v e a t: This version of wien2wannier is meant to be used with the
Wien2k version given in `wien2wannier-X.Y/WIEN-VERSION'.  Because
wien2wannier is integrated into Wien2k's `x' script, this script will
be replaced when you unpack `wien2wannier.tar'.  This can break things
if you are using a different Wien2k version.

How to continue depends on whether you have already run `siteconfig'
to configure and compile Wien2k.


2A. You have not run `siteconfig' yet
=====================================

Just follow the steps in `siteconfig' as you would normally,
wien2wannier will be compiled together with Wien2k.


2B. Wien2k is already configured and compiled
=============================================

Because wien2wannier reads the binary `vector' file, it needs to be
compiled with the same compiler as Wien2k.  You can use the
`siteconfig' script to propagate these settings to wien2wannier's
makefiles, then compile.  For your convenience, there is a simple
shell script `wien2wannier-X.Y/compile_wien2wannier.sh' which runs the
necessary commands.  I.e., in the $WIENROOT directory, run

   $ .../wien2wannier-X.Y/compile_wien2wannier.sh


3. Wannier90
============

Again, Wannier90 should be compiled with the same settings as before,
because wien2wannier needs to read the binary chk file. You can find
these settings in `$WIENROOT/{COMPILER,OPTIONS}'.  Wannier90 can be
downloaded from <http://wannier.org>, and we refer to its
documentation for installation instructions. To use it together with
wien2wannier, you need to have the executable `wannier90.x' in your
$PATH.

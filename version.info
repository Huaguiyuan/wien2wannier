3) w2w/main.f: changed line 23 from
   INTEGER CENTERATOM(100)
to
   INTEGER CENTERATOM(300)
to cover larger cases
4) w2w/read_vec.f increased maxx/maxy/maxz by one solving some bug for
   FCC cases (thanks to Z. Zhong)
5) w2w/write_win.f: solved problem for hexagonal systems (thanks to H.Yang)

+++Version 0.95(12/13/11) #repaired a bug
1) updated some of *.frc files which had wrong handling of
   complex/real versions
2)plane.frc changed line 131 from
           sum=sum+a_(1:num,I,k1)*FF
to
           sum=sum+a_(1:nb,I,k1)*FF
3)util.f changed format for struct readin in mult line from A16 to A15

+++Version 0.94b(07/20/11) #minor updates
1)woptic: introduced SO version
2)woptic: kmesh handling for systems without inversion symmetry

+++Version 0.94(06/10/11) #introduced woptic for optical conductivity
1)woptic: program to compute optical conductivity with Wannier orbitals
          includes adaptive k-mesh refinement
          includes option to use the Peierls approximation for opt.cond.
2)woptic: introduced a new program convert_Hamiltonian which
          does the Fourier-transform of the real space Hamiltonian
          H(R) from case_hr.dat to H(k) in case.ham_fine
          H(k) can be used e.g. for DMFT calculations
3)util: minor changes in write_win to cover orthorhombic k-meshes
4)init_w2w: the klist from wannier90 is now stored in case.klist_w90

+++Version 0.93(10/21/10) #some bug fixes from PW
1)wplot/auglo.frc: solved problem with humps in some pictures
                   connected to local orbital contributions
2)util: introduced w2wsp -so for SO calculations
3)util: adapted get_seedname.sh
4)userguide: introduced FAQ section
5)all programs: included help flag -h

+++Version 0.92(08/12/10) #some bug fixes(thanks to Jian-Xin Zhu) and additional stuff from PW
1)w2w/l2amm.frc,line 230 changed pi2lo to pi12lo
2)w2w/planew.frc: changed some variable defs
3)w2w/main.f: comment out some unneeded read-ins
4)util: introduced prepare_plotsp.sh for sp runs
5)util: introduced wplot2xsfsp.py for sp runs
6)util: minor changes in wannier90.xup/dn
7)util: introduced combine_spinfiles, fortran program to combine
        sp files amn,mmn,eig for the use in SO calculations
8)util: introduced prepare_plotsso.sh/wplotso for SO runs
9)util: changed write_wplotdef.f to take options soup/sodn for SO runs
10)util: introduced join_vectorfiles to join vector/energy files from a parallel
         lapw1 run

+++Version 0.9(04/19/10)  #improved user guide, Philipp Wissgott
1)updated user guide
2)updated init_lapw

+++Version 0.5(04/15/10)  #introduced init_w2w, from P.Wissgott and J.Kunes
1)init_w2w does now most of the initialization for w2w
